/**
 * MWEMetadata windows can have overlap. This class represent an overlap of two adjacent context windows.
 *
 * </p>This includes the previous and following context window objects, and the list of terms (multi-set) appearing
 * in the overlapping zone. So a context window in sentence 1, with start token index=1 and end token index=10
 * has an overlap with a context window in the same sentence with start token=6 and end token=15. The list of terms
 * stored along this object appear between token index=5 and token index=10 in sentence 1.
